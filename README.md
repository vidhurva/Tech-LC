# Tech-LC
A series of tech and design workshops in Fordham's Tech@LC club

// Tech@LC is a club that allows students to engage in tech, software, and coding with our workshop meetings. As an eboard member (workshop manager), I am in charge of facilitating and implementing workshops along with my fellow eboard members. 


// I will be uploading our sample workshops throughout the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 semester.
